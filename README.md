# Bengaluru House Price Prediction

This project is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts house prices in Bengaluru using key features such as location, total square feet, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and area type. It is built using Python, Random Forest, and Streamlit, and provides an interactive interface where users can enter property details and get an instant price estimate. The project demonstrates the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment through a simple web application.
